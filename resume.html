                <h2>EXPERIENCES</h2>
                <h3>Milwaukee Tool NPD Hydraulics Group, Brookfield, WI	Jun 2021 – Aug 2021</h3>
                <h4><strong style="margin-top: 0;">Mechanical Engineering Intern</strong></h4>
                        <li>Constructed three MATLAB Simscape models for an unreleased hydraulic pressing tool</li>
                        <li>Sped up the product development process and saved budget by allowing the team to simulate actual outputs and evaluate designs without physically modifying prototypes</li>
                        <li>Designed a user interface using MATLAB App Designer with all 3 models and 12 types of loads configured to allow users with any background to utilize the model efficiently</li>
                <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
                    <h3><strong>Engine Design Non-Disclosure Research Project	Sep 2020 – May 2021</strong></h3>
                    <li>Cooperated with Cummings to design a balanced Inline 3-cylinder engine</li>
                    <li>Conducted detailed kinematic analysis on the piston-crank system and demonstrated a 20% of increase in fuel efficiency and 90% of reduction in pitching and rolling vibrations resulted from applying balancing shafts</li>
                    <li>Designed the flywheel in SolidWorks and worked with other teammates to integrate individual components to a complete design</li> 

                    <h3><strong>Dynamics and Control of a 6-DOF Robot Arm	Mar 2021 – May 2021</strong></h3>
                    <li>Compiled a MATLAB script which generates the forward kinematics of a S12 robot</li>
                    <li>Developed a MATLAB script which calculates all the possible joint angles of any given pose using inverse kinematics</li>
                    <li>Calculated all the velocity and position singularities given certain poses using MATLAB</li>
                    <li>Controlled the robot with inverse dynamics control, PD feedback controller, and a model-based tracking controller</li>
                    <li>Demonstrated all the singularities and inverse kinematic solutions using the built-in software of the robot</li>
                    <h3><strong>Robot Tank Server and GUI Design	Mar 2021 – May 2021</strong></h3>
                    <li>Programmed and designed web servers with Node, Python SSH, MQTT, and Firestore to achieve live communications among the tank, PC, and Raspberry Pi</li>
                    <li>Designed a customized GUI programs that controls the tank using MATLAB App Designer and Kivy</li>
                    <li>Implemented forward and inverse kinematics along with solid modeling to achieve synchronized movements of the tank both in the MATLAB GUI and reality</li>

                    <h3><strong>SolidWorks Modeling Project	Nov 2020 – Feb 2021</strong></h3>
                    <li>Designed a customized plastic restaurant pager housing with strong manufacturability and aesthetic branding</li> 
                    <li>Utilized the Design for Manufacturability concepts (appropriate drafting, undercut eliminations, and uniform wall thickness) to ensure the product can be produced by single-pulled injection molding</li> 
                    <li>Replaced all the screw bosses with pin attachments and snap fits to reduce the manufacturing cost</li>
                    <h3><strong>Remote-Controlled Kart with Automatic Stop System	Nov 2019 – Feb 2020</strong></h3>
                    <li>Modeled the chassis and designed the layout of all the components after detailed measurements of the selected parts</li>
