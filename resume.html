<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute, IN	Feb 2022
B.S. Major in Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Computer Science, Minor in Robotics
	GPA: 3.62/4.0
EXPERIENCES
Milwaukee Tool NPD Hydraulics Group, Brookfield, WI	Jun 2021 – Aug 2021
Mechanical Engineering Intern
•	Constructed three MATLAB Simscape models for an unreleased hydraulic pressing tool
•	Sped up the product development process and saved budget by allowing the team to simulate actual outputs and evaluate designs without physically modifying prototypes
•	Designed a user interface using MATLAB App Designer with all 3 models and 12 types of loads configured to allow users with any background to utilize the model efficiently

PROJECTS
Engine Design Non-Disclosure Research Project	Sep 2020 – May 2021
•	Cooperated with Cummings to design a balanced Inline 3-cylinder engine
•	Conducted detailed kinematic analysis on the piston-crank system and demonstrated a 20% of increase in fuel efficiency and 90% of reduction in pitching and rolling vibrations resulted from applying balancing shafts
•	Designed the flywheel in SolidWorks and worked with other teammates to integrate individual components to a complete design 

Dynamics and Control of a 6-DOF Robot Arm	Mar 2021 – May 2021
•	Compiled a MATLAB script which generates the forward kinematics of a S12 robot
•	Developed a MATLAB script which calculates all the possible joint angles of any given pose using inverse kinematics
•	Calculated all the velocity and position singularities given certain poses using MATLAB
•	Controlled the robot with inverse dynamics control, PD feedback controller, and a model-based tracking controller
•	Demonstrated all the singularities and inverse kinematic solutions using the built-in software of the robot
Robot Tank Server and GUI Design	Mar 2021 – May 2021
•	Programmed and designed web servers with Node, Python SSH, MQTT, and Firestore to achieve live communications among the tank, PC, and Raspberry Pi
•	Designed a customized GUI programs that controls the tank using MATLAB App Designer and Kivy
•	Implemented forward and inverse kinematics along with solid modeling to achieve synchronized movements of the tank both in the MATLAB GUI and reality

SolidWorks Modeling Project	Nov 2020 – Feb 2021
•	Designed a customized plastic restaurant pager housing with strong manufacturability and aesthetic branding 
•	Utilized the Design for Manufacturability concepts (appropriate drafting, undercut eliminations, and uniform wall thickness) to ensure the product can be produced by single-pulled injection molding 
•	Replaced all the screw bosses with pin attachments and snap fits to reduce the manufacturing cost
Remote-Controlled Kart with Automatic Stop System	Nov 2019 – Feb 2020
•	Modeled the chassis and designed the layout of all the components after detailed measurements of the selected parts
•	3D Printed the chassis and assembled all the parts including DC motors, servo motors, shafts, wheels, and a microcontroller 
•	Compiled the microcontroller with Arduino and implemented IR remote to control the movement of the kart
•	Enabled obstacle detection and avoidance with an ultrasonic sensor
SKILLS
Modeling:  SolidWorks, NX, LucidShape, MATLAB Simulink, Simscape, Sisotool
Programming: OpenCV, Java, Python, Maple, MATLAB App designer, Arduino, and C.
