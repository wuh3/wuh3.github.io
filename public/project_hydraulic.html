                    <p> I spent the Summer 2021 working as a Mechanical Engineering Intern at Milwaukee Tool NPD Hydraulic Group. I was in charge of building a MATLAB
                        Simscape model for an unreleased hydraulic pressing tool. The three months I spent there is one of my greatest experiences in my life. I not long learned 
                        beneficial industrial skills but also gained confidence as a professional engineer. Everyone there was friendly and always being helpful. I felt that I have 
                        became one of the Milwaukee engineers who is "Obssessed" with efficiency and quality, and it was such a sadness for me to leave there.

                <p>For the project, Ionstructed three MATLAB Simscape models for an unreleased hydraulic pressing tool. My prject sped up the product development process and 
                    saved tons of budget by allowing the team to simulate actual outputs and evaluate designs without physically modifying prototypes. I also designed a user interface 
                    using MATLAB App Designer with all 3 models and 12 types of loads configured to allow users with any background to utilize the model efficiently.
